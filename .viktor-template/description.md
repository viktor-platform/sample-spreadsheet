This application shows how to connect an Excel spreadsheet to perform calculations. In this
example a simply supported beam under load is analyzed.

A user can specify the dimensions of the beam and the applied loads. In the spreadsheet the
following plots are automatically generated:

- Deflection
- Moment distribution
- Stress distribution
- Shear force distribution

As an example, the Deflection plot is extracted and shown to the user, however this can easily
be updated to any plot of interest!
